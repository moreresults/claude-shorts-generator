# Claude + n8n + HeyGen Short-Form Video Generator

Send a topic to a Telegram bot. Get a finished YouTube video uploaded to your channel. No editing, no recording, no manual steps in between.

This repo has the four n8n workflows, the Claude skill file, and the setup docs for the AI video automation system I built and run on my own channel.

**Stack:** Claude Code (routine) + n8n + HeyGen Video Agent + vidIQ + Telegram + Google Sheets + YouTube Data API

---

## What this actually does

You message a Telegram bot with a video topic. Claude picks it up, researches keywords with vidIQ, writes the script in your voice, and sends it to you for approval. You approve or ask for changes right from your phone. Once approved, Claude sends the script to HeyGen's Video Agent, which renders a full video with your avatar, captions, motion graphics and B-roll. n8n catches the finished video and uploads it to YouTube with the title and description already written.

Two ways to run it:

1. **Topic mode.** You send an idea. Claude researches and writes the script. You review it.
2. **Script mode.** You already have a script. You paste it. No review step. It goes straight to production.

```

Workflows 1, 2 and 3 all talk to the Claude Code routine. Workflow 4 is fully independent. That matters, because HeyGen can take a long time to render and you do not want a Claude session sitting there waiting.

## Quick start

1. Read `docs/01-requirements.md` and get your accounts ready.
2. Fork this repo. You need your own copy, because Claude reads the skill file from your repo.
3. Edit `skill/reference/brand-kit.md` with your HeyGen avatar ID and voice ID.
4. Replace `skill/reference/example-scripts.md` with two or three of your own scripts.
5. Import the four JSON files into n8n. Reconnect every credential.
6. Set up the Claude Code routine following `docs/07-claude-routine-setup.md`.
7. Message your Telegram bot the word `topic`. Send an idea. Watch it run.

Do not skip step 4. The example scripts are what make the output sound like you instead of sounding like a chatbot.

---

## How the Telegram intake works

The bot listens for two keywords.

**Send `topic` or `idea`:**
The bot replies asking for your topic. You send it back in this format:

```
How I automated my entire YouTube channel [angle: show the actual cost breakdown] [cta: link in description] (use vidiq)
```

Only the topic is required. Angle, CTA and the vidIQ flag are all optional.

**Send `script`:**
The bot asks for a ready-made script. Whatever you paste is treated as already approved. No review step. It goes straight to HeyGen.

### The vidIQ flag

Append one of these to your topic text:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `(use vidiq)` | Runs keyword research. Default behaviour. |
| `(no vidiq)` or `(skip vidiq)` | Skips research entirely. |

Use `(no vidiq)` for personal stories, opinion videos and build logs. There is no keyword angle on those and vidIQ credits are not free.

---

## How the approval loop works

Telegram has a 4096 character limit per message. A full script blows past that. So the notification and the script are split.

Telegram gets a short message: topic, title, and a link.
The n8n form page shows the full script, the title, the description, and two buttons.

Approve, and it goes to production. Request changes, and your notes go back to Claude, Claude rewrites, and you get a fresh form. This loops until you approve.

## Why HeyGen Video Agent and not the plain avatar API

Plain talking-head renders look cheap. That was the honest problem with version one of this system. Video Agent generates captions, motion graphics and B-roll around the avatar, so the output actually looks like a video someone made on purpose.

It costs more credits. That trade is worth it.

Two things to know:

- The prompt is **one shot**. You send the full script and every visual instruction in a single prompt. Do not build a back-and-forth conversation with the agent. The prompt template is in `skill/reference/video-agent-prompt.md`.
- The Video Agent endpoint takes `prompt`, `avatarId`, `voiceId` and `files`. There is **no audio asset input**. You cannot feed it an external voiceover from ElevenLabs or Fish Audio. I tried. It does not exist. Use a HeyGen TTS voice passed as `voiceId`.

### The credit trap

If you are on a HeyGen web plan (Creator, Team), your plan credits and your API credits are two separate wallets. An API key bills the API wallet, which is empty unless you top it up, and web plans cannot buy one-time API packs.

**Use the HeyGen MCP connector, not a raw API key.** MCP bills your web plan credits. This one detail saves you from paying twice.

## Customizing this for your niche

The workflows stay the same. Two files change.

**`skill/SKILL.md`** — you can edit the script length targets, the research step, the approval rules and the video style rules. The overall structure should stay as is.

**`skill/reference/example-scripts.md`** — this one you must change. Drop in your own scripts. This is the single biggest lever on output quality. Claude matches what it sees here.

**`skill/reference/brand-kit.md`** — your avatar, your voice, your colors.

Full guidance in `docs/08-customize-for-your-niche.md`.

## Before you publish your own fork

The n8n JSON exports in this repo have been sanitized. Yours will not be, unless you sanitize them. Bot tokens, chat IDs, spreadsheet IDs, webhook URLs and credential references all end up in an export.

Read `SANITIZE.md` before your first push. There is a checklist and a prompt you can paste into Claude to scan the files for you.

---

## FAQ

**Do I need to code?**
No. You import JSON, click through credential screens, and edit markdown files.

**Can I use a different avatar tool?**
The four workflows are HeyGen-specific in workflow 4 only. Swap the download step and it works with anything that returns a video URL.

**Does it upload publicly?**
No. Workflow 4 uploads as **unlisted** on purpose. You check the video, then publish manually. Change one field if you want it public.

**How long does one video take?**
About 3 to 6 minutes of your attention. Send topic, read script, approve. The rendering happens without you.

**Does this work with a self-hosted n8n?**
Yes. That is what I recommend for a team setup.
